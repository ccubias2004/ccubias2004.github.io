### CPSC 120


* Lab 1


   Lab 1 is where it all began for me. It was one of the few things that actually introduced me to computer science.
   Although it was a little basic compared to the rest of the labs, some of the things I learned from it helped me
   later on throughout the semester.


* Lab 6
  
   Lab 6 is an example of calculations. Although there were previous labs that did calculations, I believe this one gave me
   more of a struggle. Although I did struggle, I learned a lot about my work throughout the lab.


* Lab 9

    Lab 9 was one of the more difficult labs I had this semester. I learned a lot more of vectors and reading certain files which was very new to me. Although difficult, I had fun with this lab with and without it's struggles.
